# Capstone Project

## API Information ##
Because Heroku no longer offers a free hosting package, I've included an sql file so that anyone with PostgreSQL can create their own database and play with the app.

## Overview ##
I have create an app that gives artists and venues a way of sharing and maintaining a common calendar. Logged in users can submit event requests, and Admin/Venue users can approve, reject, and delete those requests. There is both basic frontend and backend authentication, and the app makes use of React & React Bootstrap for the frontend, and Node.js for the backend. It makes use of PostgreSQL as a database, and demonstrates my fundamental knowledge of database creation, queries, and handling.

## Shortcomings ##
This app is very basic in its style and form, but it does solve a basic problem inherent in the local music industry in my town, which having a shared calendar in a unified place. There are some issues with some of the testing as I simply ran out of time having spent the better part of a month on the project. I also am disatisfied with some of the "put" functionality, because it doesn't perform exactly as expected; however, overall, I am satisfied with what this app demonstrates in so far as my skills.
